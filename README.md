Official repository for the paper "Diving into Clarity: Restoring Underwater Images using Deep Learning", which appear at Springer Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems 2023. Here, we consider the targeted image editing problem: enhancing the quality of underwater images using deep learning techniques. The approach involves learning optimal parameter values for enhancing underwater images through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression model and applying a set of intensity transformation techniques to process the raw images.

We aim to enhance underwater images by addressing issues like water absorption, scattering, and low visibility through a deep learning approach. By training a CNN regression model on a diverse dataset of underwater images, we can learn the optimal parameters for enhancing these images. Subsequently, a series of intensity transformation techniques, including contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, and gamma correction, are applied to improve the visual quality of the images.
